# react-playground

This is a WIP and just for fun! âš½ not meant for prod use. At least not yet ðŸ˜€

Simple React App that has:

- React
- Redux
- React-Router
- Bootstrap
- Dev / Prod build
- Hot Reloading
- Cache busting
- post css / auto prefixer, css next, nesting

## Pending

- Tape unit testing / coverage
- i18n support
- dev/prod build
- redux store
- react demo

## Usage

Install dependencies with: 

```bash
yarn
```

You can start dev server with `yarn start` or `yarn run start:prod` (for the production build). If you just want to generate the build you can run `yarn build` or `yarn build:prod`.
